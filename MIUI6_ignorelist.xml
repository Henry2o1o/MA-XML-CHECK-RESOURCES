<!-- 	All string/array/plural names in this file are untranslateable.
	These strings only take space or mess something up. These strings can be removed.

	This file uses a specific format
	- First the application name: This must be the exact same name as the application in the language repository
	- Second the file type
	- Third the actual name of the string
	This format prevents that strings get mixed up and will spare time while doing the initial check.

	Please keep the applications and file types in alfabetical order, to keep the overview. -->
